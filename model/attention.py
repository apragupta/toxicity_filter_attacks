def attention(inputs, attention_size, time_major=False, return_alphas=True):
    """
    Attention mechanism layer which reduces RNN/Bi-RNN outputs with Attention vector.

    Args:
        inputs: The Attention inputs.
        attention_size: Linear size of the Attention weights.
        time_major: The shape format of the `inputs` Tensors.
            If true, these `Tensors` must be shaped `[max_time, batch_size, depth]`.
            If false, these `Tensors` must be shaped `[batch_size, max_time, depth]`.
            Using `time_major = True` is a bit more efficient because it avoids
            transposes at the beginning and end of the RNN calculation.  However,
            most TensorFlow data is batch-major, so by default this function
            accepts input and emits output in batch-major form.
        return_alphas: Whether to return attention coefficients variable along with layer's output.
            Used for visualization purpose.
    Returns:
        The Attention output `Tensor`.
        In case of RNN, this will be a `Tensor` shaped:
            `[batch_size, cell.output_size]`.
        In case of Bidirectional RNN, this will be a `Tensor` shaped:
            `[batch_size, cell_fw.output_size + cell_bw.output_size]`.
